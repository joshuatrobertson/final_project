  abstract = {Traditional waterfall project methodologies have been used for years to implement complex and large-scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects. Often, ERP projects are over budget and late in schedule. Stakeholders are often disappointed in the delayed realization of benefits and the quality of the delivered product. In today's economy, it is a reality that we need to be able to deliver our projects with fixed constraints on resources. This paper discusses how Lean principles and agile techniques can be used to create a high-performing ERP team that will deliver high value and high quality products to your stakeholders in a shorter period of time. It discusses how to create cross-functional teams that are collaborative, adaptive, and responsive to customer needs. It will also show how to transform your ERP team to increase productivity so you can realize benefits sooner. In addition, this paper will introduce assessment areas and evaluation criteria on how to determine the appropriate approach for your},

  abstract = {Wireframes range from the classic sketch on the back of a napkin to full design comprehensives used for documenting the design to programmers. An early wireframe is intended to provide an early approximation of a software idea. Regardless of the medium in which it is created, a wireframe has a short lifespan. Its quick production allows experimentation with much different visualizations during the early stages of product design. This quickness makes wireframe a low investment in time, cost, and effort, but it is also short-lived because of its nature of addressing immediate needs only. Though short in lifespan, wireframes usually inform a more thorough and longer living prototype, such as a storyboard or digital interactive prototype. Furthermore, wireframes are nevertheless among the most influential and most important prototype methods because the most innovative ideas tend to arise from them. The low resource investment means that more risky ideas can be tried, reiterated, and even thrown away without much cost to the overall project.},

We argue that there are significant methodological and practical difficulties for personas. It is difficult to determine how many, if any, users are represented by a persona, and thus is difficult to know whether a persona is relevant for intended users. Personas cannot be adequately verified or falsified and therefore have no demonstrable validity. We believe personas are likely to lead to political conflicts and to undermine the ability for researchers to resolve questions with data. We suggest potential research to evaluate the Personas method more thoroughly. Until the methodological issues are resolved, it is best not to consider personas to be a means to communicate data.},

  location = {{Boston}},
  abstract = {“Eric Evans has written a fantastic book on how you can make the design of your software match your mental model of the problem domain you are addressing.  “His book is very compatible with XP. It is not about drawing pictures of a domain; it is about how you think of it, the language you use to talk about it, and how you organize your software to reflect your improving understanding of it. Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as likely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning, and so refactoring is a big part of his technique.  “The book is a fun read. Eric has lots of interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this book as essential reading for software developers―it is a future classic.”  ―Ralph Johnson, author of Design Patterns ~ “If you don’t think you are getting value from your investment in object-oriented programming, this book will tell you what you’ve forgotten to do. “Eric Evans convincingly argues for the importance of domain modeling as the central focus of development and provides a solid framework and set of techniques for accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up long after the methodologies du jour have gone out of fashion.”  ―Dave Collins, author of Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces  ~ “Eric weaves real-world experience modeling―and building―business applications into a practical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted practitioner, Eric’s descriptions of ubiquitous language, the benefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle management, logical and physical application structuring, and the process and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to our field.”  ―Luke Hohmann, author of Beyond Software Architecture  ~ “This book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful software developer.” ―Kent Beck ~ “What Eric has managed to capture is a part of the design process that experienced object designers have always used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a group in conveying to the rest of the industry. We've given away bits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and systematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is important.” ―Kyle Brown, author of Enterprise Java™ Programming with IBM® WebSphere® ~ The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process. ~ Domain-Driven Design fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. ~ Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis―refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code―in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:  Getting all team members to speak the same language Connecting model and implementation more deeply Sharpening key distinctions in a model Managing the lifecycle of a domain object  Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways Making complex code obvious and predictable Formulating a domain vision statement  Distilling the core of a complex domain Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model  Applying analysis patterns  Relating design patterns to the model  Maintaining model integrity in a large system Dealing with coexisting models on the same project Organizing systems with large-scale structures Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs  With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.},

Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours― sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. ~ Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. ~ The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes ~ • Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software • Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels • Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations • Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams • Implementing an effective configuration management strategy • Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation • Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements • Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases • Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies • Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing ~ Whether you’re a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than ever―so you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably.},
