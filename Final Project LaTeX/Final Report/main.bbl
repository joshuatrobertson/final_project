    Wireframes range from the classic sketch on the back of a napkin to full
  design comprehensives used for documenting the design to programmers. An
  early wireframe is intended to provide an early approximation of a software
  idea. Regardless of the medium in which it is created, a wireframe has a
  short lifespan. Its quick production allows experimentation with much
  different visualizations during the early stages of product design. This
  quickness makes wireframe a low investment in time, cost, and effort, but it
  is also short-lived because of its nature of addressing immediate needs only.
  Though short in lifespan, wireframes usually inform a more thorough and
  longer living prototype, such as a storyboard or digital interactive
  prototype. Furthermore, wireframes are nevertheless among the most
  influential and most important prototype methods because the most innovative
  ideas tend to arise from them. The low resource investment means that more
  risky ideas can be tried, reiterated, and even thrown away without much cost
  to the overall project.%

    We examine the popular Personas method and consider claims that personas
  can reflect empirical data and serve as an information source for development
  teams. We argue that there are significant methodological and practical
  difficulties for personas. It is difficult to determine how many, if any,
  users are represented by a persona, and thus is difficult to know whether a
  persona is relevant for intended users. Personas cannot be adequately
  verified or falsified and therefore have no demonstrable validity. We believe
  personas are likely to lead to political conflicts and to undermine the
  ability for researchers to resolve questions with data. We suggest potential
  research to evaluate the Personas method more thoroughly. Until the
  methodological issues are resolved, it is best not to consider personas to be
  a means to communicate data.%

    ‚ÄúEric Evans has written a fantastic book on how you can make the design
  of your software match your mental model of the problem domain you are
  addressing. ‚ÄúHis book is very compatible with XP. It is not about drawing
  pictures of a domain; it is about how you think of it, the language you use
  to talk about it, and how you organize your software to reflect your
  improving understanding of it. Eric thinks that learning about your problem
  domain is as likely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning,
  and so refactoring is a big part of his technique. ‚ÄúThe book is a fun read.
  Eric has lots of interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this
  book as essential reading for software developers‚Äïit is a future
  classic.‚Äù ‚ÄïRalph Johnson, author of Design Patterns ~ ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt
  think you are getting value from your investment in object-oriented
  programming, this book will tell you what you‚Äôve forgotten to do. ‚ÄúEric
  Evans convincingly argues for the importance of domain modeling as the
  central focus of development and provides a solid framework and set of
  techniques for accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up
  long after the methodologies du jour have gone out of fashion.‚Äù ‚ÄïDave
  Collins, author of Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces ~ ‚ÄúEric weaves
  real-world experience modeling‚Äïand building‚Äïbusiness applications into a
  practical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted
  practitioner, Eric‚Äôs descriptions of ubiquitous language, the benefits of
  sharing models with users, object life-cycle management, logical and physical
  application structuring, and the process and results of deep refactoring are
  major contributions to our field.‚Äù ‚ÄïLuke Hohmann, author of Beyond
  Software Architecture ~ ‚ÄúThis book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful
  software developer.‚Äù ‚ÄïKent Beck ~ ‚ÄúWhat Eric has managed to capture is
  a part of the design process that experienced object designers have always
  used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a group in conveying
  to the rest of the industry. We've given away bits and pieces of this
  knowledge...but we've never organized and systematized the principles of
  building domain logic. This book is important.‚Äù ‚ÄïKyle Brown, author of
  Enterprise Java‚Ñ¢ Programming with IBM¬Æ WebSphere¬Æ ~ The software
  development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to
  software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to
  express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation
  that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance,
  there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective
  domain modeling into the software development process. ~ Domain-Driven Design
  fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers
  readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an
  extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and
  fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects
  facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this
  book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate
  the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. ~
  Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort
  more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns
  provides a common language for the development team. A shift in
  emphasis‚Äïrefactoring not just the code but the model underlying the
  code‚Äïin combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads
  to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain
  expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation,
  and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger
  organizations.Specific topics covered include: Getting all team members to
  speak the same language Connecting model and implementation more deeply
  Sharpening key distinctions in a model Managing the lifecycle of a domain
  object Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways Making
  complex code obvious and predictable Formulating a domain vision statement
  Distilling the core of a complex domain Digging out implicit concepts needed
  in the model Applying analysis patterns Relating design patterns to the model
  Maintaining model integrity in a large system Dealing with coexisting models
  on the same project Organizing systems with large-scale structures
  Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs With this book in hand,
  object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the
  guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful
  domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software
  implementations.%

    Winner of the 2011 Jolt Excellence Award! Getting software released to
  users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This
  groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that
  enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new
  functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and
  testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and
  operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours‚Äï
  sometimes even minutes‚Äìno matter what the size of a project or the
  complexity of its code base. ~ Jez Humble and David Farley begin by
  presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process.
  Next, they introduce the ‚Äúdeployment pipeline,‚Äù an automated process for
  managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the
  ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure,
  data and configuration management to governance. ~ The authors introduce
  state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management
  and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key
  issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks.
  Coverage includes ~ ‚Ä¢ Automating all facets of building, integrating,
  testing, and deploying software ‚Ä¢ Implementing deployment pipelines at team
  and organizational levels ‚Ä¢ Improving collaboration between developers,
  testers, and operations ‚Ä¢ Developing features incrementally on large and

  new products, services, and software. Use case modeling provides an effective
  technique to capture customer requirements, enhance communication between
  analyst and business customers, and to form the foundation for user interface
  design and development. This presentation provides a framework for
  understanding and modeling use cases, so that product requirements can be
  more easily managed, and business customers are delighted with the final
  product.%

    Much has been written on creating personas --- both what they are good for,
  and how to create them. A common problem with personas is that they are not
  based on real customer data, and if they are, the data set is not of a sample
  size that can be considered statistically significant. In this paper, we
  describe a new method for creating and validating personas, based on the
  statistical analysis of data, which is fast and cost effective.%
